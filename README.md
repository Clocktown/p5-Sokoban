# p5-Sokoban
A simple Sokoban game in p5.js: https://clocktown.github.io/p5-Sokoban/

Move with arrow keys, reset the level with ESC. The goal is to move both of the boxes (minecraft logs) onto the golden platforms.

There is no undo yet, and the game won't even tell you that you won - it is very minimalistic.
